# career-path-recommender
Many students struggle to decide which career path suits them best in the vast tech domain—be it Machine Learning, Web Development, Cybersecurity, or others. This project aims to solve that confusion using AI.

Users provide inputs like their:

Tech interests (AI, Web Dev, etc.)

Skills (Python, SQL, Cloud, etc.)

Preferred work and learning style

Personal strengths

The app then predicts and recommends the most suitable tech career using a trained ML model.
